# Palindrome Number

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a  **palindrome**, and `false` otherwise.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- -231 <= x <= 231 - 1

 

 **Follow up:**  Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

public:
    bool isPalindrome(int x) {
        if( x<0 || (x%10==0 && x!=0))
            return false;

        int reversehalf=0;
        while(x>reversehalf){
            reversehalf=reversehalf*10 + x%10;
            x /=10;
        }
        return x == reversehalf || x==reversehalf / 10;
    }
};
```
