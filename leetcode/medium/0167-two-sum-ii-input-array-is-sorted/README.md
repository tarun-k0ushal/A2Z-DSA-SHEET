# Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given a  **1-indexed**  array of integers `numbers` that is already  **sorted in non-decreasing order**.

Find  **two**  numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return the indices of the two numbers `index1` and `index2` as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is  **exactly one solution**. You  **may not**  use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
- -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
- numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- -1000 <= target <= 1000
- The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.

        int n = numbers.size();
        int i = 0;
        int j =n-1;

        while (i<j){
            int sum = numbers[i]+numbers[j];
            if(sum<target)
            {
                i++;
            }
            else if(sum > target)
            {
                j--;
            }
            else{
            return {i+1,j+1};}
        }
        return {};

    }
};
